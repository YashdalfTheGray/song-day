## Development

Development requires `firebase-tools` to be installed. It can be installed using `(sudo) npm install -g firebase-tools`. 

After making changes, execute `firebase deploy` to push changes to the firebase hosting server. To see the changes, use `firebase open`. 

The current progress is hosted up at https://onesongaday.firebaseapp.com/.
